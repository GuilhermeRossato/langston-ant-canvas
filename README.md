# Langton ant Experiment

This is my 2016 javascript experiment to simulate a Langton's Ant Playground in a HTML5 Canvas.

[Click here](http://www.guilherme-rossato.com/langton-ant-canvas) to run experiment in it's latest version.

A Langton's Ant is a 2d turing machine with a simple rule set, but with an emerging complex behaviour.

Here's a gif from wikipedia showcasing one:
